In the end, what is important to convey is that Moldable Development is a *process* in which you ask questions about a software system, explore it, and build lots of small, custom tools to answer those questions and make the system explainable.

Moldable Development is a new way of programming that takes time to learn, but that in the end boils down to a set of learnable patterns.

Thanks for listening.'>

	<text: '## Pattern: Contextual playground

When you program in a conventional IDE, the code is strictly disconnected from any live instance.

Experimenting and exploring the state of the running program is only possible by setting breakpoints and running the code in the debugger,  or by writing additional dedicated test code.

Another way is to start coding from an Inspector on a live, moldable object.

This should remind you of the Smalltalk practice of coding in the debugger, but the difference is that you can code in an inspector without having to get a debugger instance..

Here we see a live instance of our simple EsugWebsiteWrapper with a Playground opened at the bottom.

Why is this interesting?

Because the playground is bound to the context of the object, unlike code that we write in a normal code editor.

For instance, the variable `repoDir` is bound to that slot of the live instance.

We can experiment with code in the playground, and when we see something we like, we can copy the code to a method, or even directly apply an extract method refactoring.

*(Extract the sample code as a `pillarFiles` method.)*'>

It''s critical not only to make people feel welcome and encouraged to ask any kind of questions, but their questions need to be taken seriously, and answered reasonably quickly.

	<text: '## Exploring the ESUG website

Let''s take an easy domain that we are all familiar with, namely the ESUG website.

Here we are inspecting the cloned repo of the ESUG website.

We can browse the pages of the website, see the contents of a page, the list of links, and the pages that are reachable from this page, as well as a map of the reachable pages.

*(Click on a few pages, then go to Conference 2014. Look at Contents, etc. Show the map, hover over a reachable page, and open it.)*

We can also open the page in a web browser.

From the website we also see all the links, possibly missing internal links, and the reachable pages, as well as an overall map.

In red we see the pages that seemingly are unreachable from the root.

We can also check the status of links.

*(Go the missing status and click on the check status button. NB: click on Inspect object to get a new view with Broken HTTP links.)*

Here we can see which links may be broken.

Let''s stop the background check.

Finally, we can search for pages or links by title or content.

*(Enter a query for "hotel".)*

## Recap

So what have we seen?

We have domain objects representing a website, the web pages and the links.

We have custom views for each domain object allowing us to explore the information that interests us, and to navigate to other objects.

We also have custom actions to open a web browser or to start an analysis, and we have a custom search to query lists of pages and links.

Each of these custom tools is implemented in just a few lines of code in a method of the domain object concerned annotated with a dedicated pragma.

For example, here is a view, an action, and a search.

*(Show each of these.)*

Now we get the key question:

How hard is it to teach people to build their own explainable system for their domain of interest?'>

	<text: '## Pattern: Moldable object

This is perhaps the hardest pattern to learn.

Where would you rather be when you are developing code?

Staring at the source code, or viewing the live object that you are working on?

Here we see at the top a typical Coder view of a class where we can browse and edit the methods.

But this is actually the least interesting view we can have because each method is seen divorced from the context in which it is used and interacts with other methods.

From the very first day that we start to program, we learn to write some code in a text editor, and we compile it and run it.

It always takes a few steps to see the end result.

But why not reverse this?

Below here we see a *moldable object*, that is, a live instance of the PillarWebsite object that we can interact with.

While it can be cumbersome to navigate from the code view to see its effect, it is usually easy to navigate from the live object to its code.

Suppose for, for example, that we don''t like the way the *Links* are displayed.

We can directly go to the code and change, for example, the width of the *Link* column.

*(Opt-click on the Links tab and change the `300` width to `200`.)*

From the moldable object we can experiment with new features, extract methods and examples or tests, and immediately see the effect.'>

The Glamorous Toolkit contains many pieces of technology that fit together to support moldable development.

People like to put things into boxes, so they tend to focus on the first bit of technology that captures their imagination, and so risk to lose the big picture.

For example, visualization is an important component, but it is a mistake to equate moldable development with visualization.

People hate change, or perhaps rather it''s the case that it''s extremely hard for people to change habits once they have become ingrained.

I personally took a long time to get into the habit of starting to code from live objects rather than heading to a code editor first.

The code editor is a comfortable place to start from, even if it is not very useful for exploring implementation options or understanding existing code.

What helps here best is live mentoring on a real project.

When you see over and over again the benefits of coding from live objects, you begin to build up a Pavlovian instinct to stay away from the code editor as your starting point.

Demos and videos also help, but they are not as effective as the first-hand experience.'>

Although sometimes you may have the luxury to work on a greenfield project, most projects start from some existing data and code.

When we load the data into our environment, we will obtain the default views for that data.

Here, for example, we have loaded the cloned ESUG website repo and are inspecting the contents.

We obtain a completely generic view of the folders and files that tells us nothing about the domain.

*(Evaluate the first snippet showing the FileLocator views.)*

We would like to turn this into a proper domain object that tells us interesting things about itself.

As a first step, then, we can *wrap* the data into a dedicated object.

When we do this, at first glance the result appears to be even worse, as now we just get a generic *Raw* view of the new object.

*(Inspect the first EsugWebsiteWrapper.)* 

But now we have the possibility to explore it, add behavior, and add new views.

After some iterations we obtain the view we have seen earlier.

How  do you know when to create a custom view?

This is another fundamental pattern.

The idea is that, whenever you find yourself navigating to get to some interesting objects, you should turn that navigation path into a custom view so you can get to that information directly.

Let''s look at a trivial example: as we explore the Esug website model, we navigate to the pages using a Playground snippet, and then we can navigate to individual pages.

Instead we''d like the list of pages view to be visible directly in the website object.

We can inspect that view to see that it is implemented as a `#gtItemsFor:` method in the class `SequenceableCollection`.

We could copy-paste the code and later adapt it, but as a first quick step we can simply define a *forwarding* view from the website to the collection.

We just open a Coder view and add the view that forwards to the existing view of the pages collection.

The new view is instantly available.'>
