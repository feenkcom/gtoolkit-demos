1
00:02:37,801 --> 00:02:39,325
Let us have him.

2
00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:42,436
- We've got to have him.
- Impossible, children.

3
00:02:55,886 --> 00:02:58,184
<i>Balthazar, I baptize thee</i>

4
00:02:58,422 --> 00:03:03,121
in the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost.

5
00:03:03,326 --> 00:03:04,884
Amen.

6
00:03:12,202 --> 00:03:13,567
Marie! Marie!

7
00:03:40,797 --> 00:03:42,890
Receive the salt of wisdom.

8
00:04:34,851 --> 00:04:36,011
Jacques.

9
00:04:37,053 --> 00:04:38,577
Marie.

10
00:05:30,674 --> 00:05:32,107
Jacques.

11
00:06:19,823 --> 00:06:21,381
See you next year.

12
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:21,808
YEARS GO BY...

13
00:08:44,701 --> 00:08:46,032
There he is.

14
00:09:05,855 --> 00:09:08,551
PROPERTY FOR SALE

15
00:10:15,425 --> 00:10:17,416
<i>Marie, come look!</i>

16
00:11:12,482 --> 00:11:13,949
You see...

17
00:11:20,924 --> 00:11:24,189
500 acres cleared,
plowed and ready to yield.

18
00:11:25,428 --> 00:11:27,555
Me, a schoolteacher, I did that.

19
00:11:27,764 --> 00:11:29,732
I learned it all from books.

20
00:11:30,533 --> 00:11:33,127
These fields aren't ours.
Nothing is.

21
00:11:33,336 --> 00:11:35,031
It doesn't matter.
We'll be happy.

22
00:12:11,274 --> 00:12:13,265
- Donkeys are neat.
- They're fast.

23
00:12:14,344 --> 00:12:15,868
Modern.

24
00:13:40,596 --> 00:13:43,531
She may really love him.
Him too.

25
00:13:44,434 --> 00:13:46,095
Him too what?

26
00:13:46,502 --> 00:13:48,094
Love her too.

27
00:13:48,304 --> 00:13:49,896
You don't mean?

28
00:13:50,239 --> 00:13:51,536
Yes.

29
00:13:52,175 --> 00:13:53,665
A donkey?

30
00:14:12,228 --> 00:14:13,786
In mythology...

31
00:14:13,996 --> 00:14:15,293
Mytho?

32
00:17:42,004 --> 00:17:43,904
ATTORNEY-AT-LAW

33
00:17:44,106 --> 00:17:48,372
"As I am too sad to return
to this house since my daughter's death

34
00:17:48,778 --> 00:17:50,939
and failed to sell the farms,

35
00:17:51,147 --> 00:17:54,173
why not farm the land yourself
using modern techniques,

36
00:17:54,383 --> 00:17:57,216
as you once said you'd like to?

37
00:18:01,257 --> 00:18:04,055
You would have to close
the school and resign."

38
00:18:08,564 --> 00:18:09,622
Keep reading.

39
00:18:09,832 --> 00:18:14,531
"Enclosed is my proxy for any sale,
purchase or exchange of land.

40
00:18:14,737 --> 00:18:19,003
My attorney will advance the funds
to cover your initial expenses.

41
00:18:22,611 --> 00:18:25,842
I trust you entirely.
You have carte blanche.

42
00:18:26,048 --> 00:18:28,676
You needn't consult me
or send me the accounts."

43
00:18:29,151 --> 00:18:32,780
Now he suddenly wants
the accounts examined?

44
00:18:33,489 --> 00:18:34,751
That's right.

45
00:18:35,191 --> 00:18:38,092
And if I refuse?
I'm under no obligation.

46
00:18:38,761 --> 00:18:40,661
That wouldn't be advisable,

47
00:18:40,863 --> 00:18:42,490
what with the rumors going around.

48
00:18:44,066 --> 00:18:45,328
Rumors?

49
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:56,744
Go on home with the donkey.
I prefer to walk.

50
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:09,487
<i>The sale of the woods started it.</i>

51
00:19:09,692 --> 00:19:13,128
We began getting letters,
all anonymous,

52
00:19:13,329 --> 00:19:16,560
claiming the proceeds all went
into your father's pocket, not mine.

53
00:19:17,733 --> 00:19:19,792
But without proof, of course.

54
00:19:20,202 --> 00:19:21,601
It's despicable.

55
00:19:22,938 --> 00:19:26,339
That's the cost of your father's success.
Envy and jealousy.

56
00:19:27,977 --> 00:19:31,003
Papa's blameless.
He can look your father in the eye.

57
00:19:31,614 --> 00:19:32,979
I came to settle this.

58
00:19:33,182 --> 00:19:36,151
Your father thinks
he pocketed all the money?

59
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:42,213
He's hurt Papa,
who never asked for anything in return.

60
00:19:48,297 --> 00:19:49,924
Yes, it's Balthazar.

61
00:19:53,302 --> 00:19:55,827
Oh, Marie, nothing's changed!

62
00:19:57,606 --> 00:19:59,506
But you're prettier than ever.

63
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:03,101
Both prettier and more beautiful.

64
00:20:04,814 --> 00:20:07,977
Remember the promise I once made
on this very bench?

65
00:20:10,085 --> 00:20:11,985
That I'd love only you?

66
00:20:15,224 --> 00:20:17,749
But, Jacques,
I'm not sure I love you.

67
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,957
Is it that hard to know?

68
00:20:20,162 --> 00:20:23,188
If I don't love you,
I don't want to lie to you.

69
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:25,361
Aren't you happy to be with me?

70
00:20:25,868 --> 00:20:27,199
Very happy, Jacques.

71
00:20:35,344 --> 00:20:37,812
You go in alone and talk to him.

72
00:20:38,013 --> 00:20:40,709
Don't let this nonsense
come between us.

73
00:21:20,623 --> 00:21:21,590
Leaving?

74
00:21:21,957 --> 00:21:23,720
Will I ever see you again?

75
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:44,072
One word would have settled everything,

76
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,975
but you were too proud.

77
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:49,781
Why should I make the first move?

78
00:21:50,986 --> 00:21:53,079
The boy was on your side,

79
00:21:53,289 --> 00:21:55,154
but you had to throw him out.

80
00:22:34,296 --> 00:22:36,161
Let me have the accounts.

81
00:22:36,966 --> 00:22:40,333
That's my business.
I'm not answerable to anyone.

82
00:22:40,636 --> 00:22:42,661
Besides, I can't find them.

83
00:22:42,905 --> 00:22:46,773
Forget the insults. You'll only
prove the rumormongers right.

84
00:22:46,976 --> 00:22:49,444
A lawsuit will decide who's right.

85
00:22:54,883 --> 00:22:58,216
If Marie refuses to feed him
and stays in her room,

86
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,479
I don't see why
we should keep him.

87
00:23:03,225 --> 00:23:06,217
That antiquated donkey
makes us look ridiculous.

88
00:23:06,829 --> 00:23:07,921
Not at all.

89
00:23:08,697 --> 00:23:11,325
Ridicule is the one thing
we must avoid at all costs.

90
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:43,289
<i>I hear he does odd jobs for free,</i>

91
00:23:43,499 --> 00:23:45,558
<i>like chopping his firewood.</i>

92
00:23:45,968 --> 00:23:47,401
He's obliging and clever.

93
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:52,570
- So the priest covers for him.
- Then why did you take him on?

94
00:23:52,941 --> 00:23:54,909
I'm trying him out for a week.

95
00:27:32,861 --> 00:27:34,795
Good night, Gérard.

96
00:28:24,046 --> 00:28:25,445
Get out!

97
00:28:27,416 --> 00:28:28,474
Right now!

98
00:28:29,651 --> 00:28:30,879
I'm telling you!

99
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,092
Where are you going?

100
00:32:10,071 --> 00:32:11,265
Nowhere.

101
00:32:11,473 --> 00:32:12,997
Then get back inside.

102
00:32:50,011 --> 00:32:51,774
What are you doing here?

103
00:32:54,049 --> 00:32:55,744
Looking for what's mine.

104
00:32:56,718 --> 00:32:58,379
Me, I'm not a thief.

105
00:32:58,753 --> 00:33:00,050
Get out of here!

106
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,091
Now!

107
00:33:51,006 --> 00:33:52,735
Something wrong?

108
00:33:56,745 --> 00:33:58,007
Gérard is wonderful.

109
00:33:58,213 --> 00:34:01,808
He brought in the wood and the flour
without telling anyone.

110
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,601
It was you, Gérard.

111
00:34:27,809 --> 00:34:28,969
Me?

112
00:34:37,185 --> 00:34:38,709
Don't deny it.

113
00:34:41,756 --> 00:34:43,815
If you need money, ask.

114
00:34:44,025 --> 00:34:45,219
Sure.

115
00:34:45,694 --> 00:34:48,595
I'll see you lack for nothing.

116
00:34:51,433 --> 00:34:53,731
I bought you a present
to thank you.

117
00:34:56,671 --> 00:34:58,036
What is it?

118
00:35:14,155 --> 00:35:15,213
Look there.

119
00:35:27,869 --> 00:35:30,929
But I'll take back
the radio, bike and money

120
00:35:31,139 --> 00:35:33,004
if I see you with that Marie again!

121
00:37:46,207 --> 00:37:48,402
Where have you been?

122
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:50,908
POLICE SUMMONS

123
00:38:08,096 --> 00:38:09,427
We'll hide you.

124
00:38:09,631 --> 00:38:11,462
You can cross the border tonight.

125
00:38:15,703 --> 00:38:17,261
Don't make fun of me.

126
00:38:20,608 --> 00:38:22,337
Don't mock my tears.

127
00:38:46,935 --> 00:38:50,371
Why should I keep quiet?
You're on the wrong track, sir.

128
00:38:50,572 --> 00:38:52,369
No one asked you.

129
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:54,537
They're incapable of it.

130
00:38:56,678 --> 00:38:59,044
They're braggarts and sissies.
I spit on them.

131
00:39:03,551 --> 00:39:04,848
Your papers.

132
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:07,285
I'll hold on to them for now.

133
00:39:09,757 --> 00:39:11,554
Your hands. Your thumbs.

134
00:39:22,103 --> 00:39:23,832
Holding on to me too?

135
00:39:25,073 --> 00:39:28,133
Not yet. But we'll keep an eye on you.
Remember that.

136
00:39:33,581 --> 00:39:34,639
You can go.

137
00:39:37,085 --> 00:39:39,053
Drop dead, you pig!

138
00:40:00,942 --> 00:40:03,342
<i>That's my business.
I won't answer.</i>

139
00:40:04,212 --> 00:40:06,942
How do you explain
that your pals answered?

140
00:40:07,482 --> 00:40:08,949
How do I explain it?

141
00:40:10,852 --> 00:40:12,319
Is it up to me to explain?

142
00:40:13,187 --> 00:40:14,745
Since you suspect me,

143
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:17,082
maybe I'm your man.

144
00:40:17,792 --> 00:40:18,850
How's that?

145
00:40:20,128 --> 00:40:21,425
The killer.

146
00:40:21,663 --> 00:40:23,756
How? When? Alone?

147
00:40:25,633 --> 00:40:28,033
These gentlemen
had nothing to do with it.

148
00:40:29,203 --> 00:40:32,536
You said you never thought
of smuggling goods

149
00:40:33,141 --> 00:40:35,405
or even going near the border.

150
00:40:38,179 --> 00:40:39,942
That was to fool the police.

151
00:40:40,982 --> 00:40:42,609
Enough of this nonsense.

152
00:40:43,551 --> 00:40:45,109
Book him.

153
00:40:45,319 --> 00:40:46,581
No, I'm innocent!

154
00:40:46,788 --> 00:40:49,814
For boasting
and obstruction of justice!

155
00:40:50,024 --> 00:40:51,582
For stupidity!

156
00:40:53,561 --> 00:40:55,188
Off with you! Get out!

157
00:41:10,411 --> 00:41:11,776
What do you want?

158
00:41:12,013 --> 00:41:14,106
You know too much about us.

159
00:41:16,951 --> 00:41:18,009
Stool pigeon!

160
00:41:22,356 --> 00:41:23,914
Clear out!

161
00:41:29,397 --> 00:41:31,524
I testified in your favor.

162
00:41:32,166 --> 00:41:33,098
Clear out!

163
00:41:33,701 --> 00:41:37,262
You fingered us to throw the police off.
You're the killer.

164
00:41:37,538 --> 00:41:38,971
I doubt it!

165
00:41:39,307 --> 00:41:41,571
Doubt that a drunken madman
like you

166
00:41:41,776 --> 00:41:45,007
could murder someone
and not remember it?

167
00:41:45,246 --> 00:41:46,270
Clear off!

168
00:41:47,482 --> 00:41:50,007
So why'd they take your fingerprints?

169
00:42:04,499 --> 00:42:05,625
Murderer.

170
00:42:06,501 --> 00:42:08,366
Well, they didn't lock me up.

171
00:42:08,569 --> 00:42:09,968
The courts are slow.

172
00:42:10,171 --> 00:42:11,069
How long?

173
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,707
Months. A year, maybe.

174
00:42:14,275 --> 00:42:15,401
Liar.

175
00:42:15,777 --> 00:42:16,937
Say that again.

176
00:42:44,739 --> 00:42:46,263
Stop it!

177
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:50,436
Coward!

178
00:44:16,297 --> 00:44:17,924
Look how he's shivering.

179
00:44:33,681 --> 00:44:37,014
It's been two months
and no sign of improvement.

180
00:44:37,418 --> 00:44:38,715
Poor beast.

181
00:44:39,787 --> 00:44:41,311
It'll be quick.

182
00:44:43,624 --> 00:44:44,488
<i>Stop!</i>

183
00:44:51,032 --> 00:44:52,624
Murderer!

184
00:44:52,967 --> 00:44:54,798
I'll take him off your hands.

185
00:44:55,336 --> 00:44:57,065
But he can't even get up.

186
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:00,532
I'll take him with me.

187
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:24,498
Being on the road cured him.

188
00:45:50,424 --> 00:45:52,551
<i>Then onto my canvas burst</i>

189
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:56,252
a multitude of structures,
each with its own dialectic.

190
00:45:56,764 --> 00:45:59,665
It's what the waterfall
dictates to me,

191
00:45:59,867 --> 00:46:02,529
with no logical link between us.

192
00:46:02,870 --> 00:46:04,963
Its descent sets me in motion.

193
00:46:05,172 --> 00:46:07,538
Cerebral painting?

194
00:46:08,442 --> 00:46:11,240
Action painting.

195
00:46:29,397 --> 00:46:33,493
Can one be held responsible
for a crime one commits involuntarily

196
00:46:33,701 --> 00:46:37,603
but forgets out of nervous shock

197
00:46:37,805 --> 00:46:39,966
or due to alcohol?

198
00:46:40,174 --> 00:46:43,268
The conscious gives way
to the subconscious.

199
00:46:43,477 --> 00:46:44,535
Even to the unconscious.

200
00:46:44,745 --> 00:46:46,906
The criminal may awaken

201
00:46:47,214 --> 00:46:49,944
unaware that he's a criminal.

202
00:47:15,376 --> 00:47:17,401
Not the guillotine!

203
00:47:18,045 --> 00:47:20,013
My poor head!

204
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:31,588
By Mary, Jesus Christ her son
and all the saints,

205
00:47:31,792 --> 00:47:34,556
I swear never to touch
another drop. Amen!

206
00:47:41,402 --> 00:47:43,461
What are you afraid of, Arnold?

207
00:47:44,171 --> 00:47:45,263
Fear.

208
00:47:59,086 --> 00:48:01,577
Leaving in mid-season...
are you crazy?

209
00:48:25,679 --> 00:48:27,579
Satan! Jinx!

210
00:49:14,895 --> 00:49:17,261
Don't walk out! Stay, please!

211
00:49:18,632 --> 00:49:20,623
- He insulted me.
- Not at all.

212
00:49:21,335 --> 00:49:24,771
A court that lets the other party
insult me is no court.

213
00:49:25,372 --> 00:49:27,067
The court will sentence you

214
00:49:27,274 --> 00:49:29,208
by default if you leave.

215
00:52:11,171 --> 00:52:12,695
Leave him to me.

216
00:52:22,750 --> 00:52:25,719
- He's a waste of time.
- No, he's intelligence itself.

217
00:52:25,919 --> 00:52:28,547
Why not just call him a genius?

218
00:52:42,035 --> 00:52:43,332
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

219
00:52:43,537 --> 00:52:47,598
we're honored to introduce
the greatest mind of our century!

220
00:52:52,746 --> 00:52:55,977
Will someone give me
a three-digit number?

221
00:52:56,417 --> 00:52:57,782
<i>772.</i>

222
00:52:57,985 --> 00:52:59,543
<i>834.</i>

223
00:53:05,159 --> 00:53:07,559
Now a number
between 2 and 9.

224
00:53:11,365 --> 00:53:15,495
Now our mathematician
will calculate.

225
00:54:04,751 --> 00:54:06,514
Now a five-digit number.

226
00:54:16,396 --> 00:54:18,227
Now a three-digit number.

227
00:54:18,432 --> 00:54:20,457
<i>632.</i>

228
00:54:20,734 --> 00:54:22,463
<i>418.</i>

229
00:56:27,494 --> 00:56:29,792
Wake up, quick!
Get out of here!

230
00:56:29,997 --> 00:56:31,555
There's still time.

231
00:56:37,838 --> 00:56:40,170
Too late. Look who's here.

232
00:56:53,487 --> 00:56:56,251
You came back, you fool.
Lucky I brought a gun.

233
00:58:43,130 --> 00:58:44,324
Empty.

234
00:58:47,667 --> 00:58:49,100
On your feet, Arnold.

235
00:58:49,903 --> 00:58:52,303
I have some terrific news for you.

236
00:59:05,752 --> 00:59:08,050
<i>Come on in!
Arnold's buying drinks!</i>

237
00:59:09,122 --> 00:59:11,488
Drinks are on Arnold!

238
00:59:18,165 --> 00:59:19,894
This inheritance is real?

239
00:59:20,433 --> 00:59:23,425
Thanks to his late uncle's will,

240
00:59:23,637 --> 00:59:26,629
Arnold has come
into a considerable fortune.

241
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:30,071
The will's authenticity
is perfectly indisputable.

242
00:59:30,610 --> 00:59:32,942
There are just a few formalities.

243
00:59:57,437 --> 00:59:59,564
- I knew you'd come.
- Why shouldn't I?

244
00:59:59,773 --> 01:00:01,536
You're spying on me.

245
01:00:02,509 --> 01:00:04,704
I wanted to know
what you were up to.

246
01:00:20,026 --> 01:00:22,358
What do you see in that boy?

247
01:00:23,396 --> 01:00:24,294
I love him.

248
01:00:24,664 --> 01:00:27,895
Do we know why we love someone?
If he says "come," I come.

249
01:00:28,401 --> 01:00:29,993
"Do this," and I do it.

250
01:00:31,238 --> 01:00:32,569
Poor child.

251
01:00:34,574 --> 01:00:36,508
I'd follow him anywhere.

252
01:00:37,143 --> 01:00:38,405
If he asked me to,

253
01:00:38,645 --> 01:00:40,340
I'd kill myself for him.

254
01:01:00,901 --> 01:01:02,391
Not breaking anything?

255
01:01:03,536 --> 01:01:04,662
Not going mad?

256
01:01:10,577 --> 01:01:11,805
Drink up, you retard.

257
01:01:23,356 --> 01:01:25,153
Jerk! Moron! Leech!

258
01:02:35,261 --> 01:02:38,321
Your father's suffering.
He only lives for us.

259
01:02:38,531 --> 01:02:40,465
The grief will kill him.

260
01:02:40,967 --> 01:02:44,232
He loves his misery more than us.
He thrives on it.

261
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:49,265
This is all I ask.

262
01:02:49,609 --> 01:02:51,543
Come home with me now.

263
01:02:53,079 --> 01:02:55,070
Or we'll bring you home by force.

264
01:03:02,122 --> 01:03:03,350
Save me.

265
01:03:03,556 --> 01:03:05,786
Let's leave.
Take me far away.

266
01:03:21,508 --> 01:03:23,305
Your father will kill you.

267
01:03:24,844 --> 01:03:26,835
Papa worries himself sick over me.

268
01:03:28,782 --> 01:03:30,443
If you want her, pay.

269
01:04:10,657 --> 01:04:12,022
Old brother!

270
01:04:21,234 --> 01:04:23,964
Going far? Leaving us?

271
01:04:24,938 --> 01:04:26,530
Hurray for Arnold!

272
01:04:56,469 --> 01:04:58,562
Farewell, my poor, dear friend.

273
01:05:00,273 --> 01:05:02,764
Doomed to spend all your days

274
01:05:02,976 --> 01:05:05,137
watching the same fools go by.

275
01:05:08,081 --> 01:05:09,844
Farewell, old pal.

276
01:05:20,860 --> 01:05:22,657
And you, my friend.

277
01:05:44,918 --> 01:05:48,251
The death certificate was sent in
over two weeks ago.

278
01:05:48,454 --> 01:05:53,187
If there's no heir, we'll sell
them off when we get the order.

279
01:06:07,507 --> 01:06:09,668
ORDER OF SALE

280
01:06:13,413 --> 01:06:14,971
They'll go to the market.

281
01:08:13,266 --> 01:08:15,200
He has sores.
He needs a proper harness.

282
01:08:17,503 --> 01:08:20,631
No need. I'll do him in
when the rains come.

283
01:10:02,875 --> 01:10:04,274
Don't throw me out.

284
01:10:04,477 --> 01:10:07,173
Shame on you!
Go home to your father!

285
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:09,375
I can't and I won't.

286
01:10:09,582 --> 01:10:12,642
He had a position in society.
You've disgraced him.

287
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:16,511
It's over with Gérard and the others.

288
01:10:16,789 --> 01:10:18,916
I can't stand them anymore.

289
01:10:19,625 --> 01:10:23,083
Just give me a little spot.
There in the straw.

290
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:42,513
You're so kind.

291
01:10:50,289 --> 01:10:51,779
If you want...

292
01:10:54,393 --> 01:10:55,951
I'll give you a kiss.

293
01:11:03,469 --> 01:11:05,027
Dry off and come inside.

294
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:15,971
Give me your skirt and blouse.

295
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:29,954
- No one saw you come here?
- No one.

296
01:11:57,290 --> 01:11:58,951
It's so ugly here.

297
01:12:03,362 --> 01:12:04,852
This is a place to die in.

298
01:12:05,298 --> 01:12:07,095
With no regrets.

299
01:12:07,333 --> 01:12:08,459
Who mentioned dying?

300
01:12:09,602 --> 01:12:12,366
Me. Don't you believe in anything?

301
01:12:12,605 --> 01:12:14,368
I believe in what I own.

302
01:12:14,574 --> 01:12:17,099
I love money. I hate death.

303
01:12:19,879 --> 01:12:21,938
You'll die like everyone else.

304
01:12:23,316 --> 01:12:25,216
I'll bury them all.

305
01:12:28,387 --> 01:12:29,513
You're old.

306
01:12:31,090 --> 01:12:32,557
Not as old as all that.

307
01:12:33,292 --> 01:12:34,691
You're not handsome.

308
01:12:52,511 --> 01:12:55,309
Let me eat, you old scrooge.
I'm starving.

309
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:37,089
They say you hide gold coins
and cash in your shoes.

310
01:13:43,162 --> 01:13:44,686
What good does it do you?

311
01:14:15,561 --> 01:14:16,926
Here, take it.

312
01:14:41,954 --> 01:14:44,582
You're rich
but you don't have electricity.

313
01:14:45,791 --> 01:14:47,554
We have nothing left.

314
01:14:47,827 --> 01:14:50,853
Not even the house
and yard are ours.

315
01:14:52,064 --> 01:14:54,464
Papa gave the creditors
his last cent.

316
01:14:55,267 --> 01:14:58,532
That's what happens when
you place honor above everything.

317
01:14:59,205 --> 01:15:02,834
He's spent his life creating
obligations for himself.

318
01:15:03,042 --> 01:15:04,270
What for?

319
01:15:04,610 --> 01:15:07,170
Not one in ten believes
he's innocent.

320
01:15:09,148 --> 01:15:11,480
Do I have any obligations?

321
01:15:12,251 --> 01:15:16,517
I'm free, obliged only to do
what serves my interests

322
01:15:16,722 --> 01:15:20,453
and can bring me a profit...
and a handsome profit at that.

323
01:15:21,527 --> 01:15:23,552
Life's nothing but a fairground,

324
01:15:23,796 --> 01:15:26,356
a marketplace where even your word
is unnecessary.

325
01:15:26,565 --> 01:15:28,157
A bank note will do.

326
01:15:28,934 --> 01:15:31,994
Paying people frees you
from any obligations.

327
01:15:32,338 --> 01:15:35,273
Better still,
get them to work for nothing.

328
01:15:35,574 --> 01:15:38,065
Not everyone sees things my way.

329
01:15:38,544 --> 01:15:43,379
You quickly learn you can do as you like
and still command respect.

330
01:15:43,916 --> 01:15:46,578
It just takes nerve and flair.

331
01:15:46,852 --> 01:15:48,183
Keep it.

332
01:15:51,390 --> 01:15:53,688
It's not money I need,
but a friend.

333
01:15:53,893 --> 01:15:55,019
Yes, a friend.

334
01:15:57,496 --> 01:16:00,124
A friend who can tell me
how to run away.

335
01:16:01,967 --> 01:16:03,525
I've always wanted to.

336
01:16:04,003 --> 01:16:04,935
Run away?

337
01:16:06,038 --> 01:16:07,403
Run away.

338
01:16:09,575 --> 01:16:12,567
A friend to share
my pleasures and pains.

339
01:16:13,913 --> 01:16:16,074
I'll share your pains and pleasures.

340
01:16:16,382 --> 01:16:18,942
But I hope
it's more pleasure than pain.

341
01:16:59,291 --> 01:17:01,020
She was here an hour ago.

342
01:17:02,461 --> 01:17:04,452
You took her in and fed her.

343
01:17:05,564 --> 01:17:07,031
She sure can eat.

344
01:17:07,967 --> 01:17:09,264
She'll come home,

345
01:17:09,468 --> 01:17:11,698
like a stray child
you find and forgive.

346
01:17:14,673 --> 01:17:16,800
Yes, you'll make your peace.

347
01:17:17,743 --> 01:17:19,335
He's no longer young,

348
01:17:19,678 --> 01:17:21,873
but he can still be of use.

349
01:17:23,782 --> 01:17:25,010
Take him.

350
01:17:25,451 --> 01:17:27,043
It'll make Marie happy.

351
01:17:27,419 --> 01:17:29,284
I still owe you something.

352
01:17:29,922 --> 01:17:31,082
Nothing much.

353
01:17:31,290 --> 01:17:32,848
Hardly "nothing much."

354
01:17:33,559 --> 01:17:35,652
Call it quits. Take him.

355
01:18:00,486 --> 01:18:01,919
My little girl!

356
01:18:33,118 --> 01:18:35,143
It's all been spoiled and wasted,

357
01:18:35,354 --> 01:18:37,322
just as it was about to pay off.

358
01:18:38,057 --> 01:18:41,424
So much has been swept away
in so little time.

359
01:18:41,794 --> 01:18:43,386
<i>We must make amends.</i>

360
01:18:46,098 --> 01:18:47,429
How?

361
01:18:48,033 --> 01:18:51,230
Father wants to return
what your father lost in the suit.

362
01:18:52,871 --> 01:18:54,429
He won't accept it.

363
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:58,974
He's retreated into his pride.
He takes pride in his suffering.

364
01:19:01,013 --> 01:19:04,278
Oh, Jacques, how I've dreamed
about you, a boy like you,

365
01:19:05,050 --> 01:19:06,244
honest, a bit silly,

366
01:19:06,452 --> 01:19:09,785
who'd say, "Be mine.

367
01:19:09,989 --> 01:19:11,320
It's not your fault."

368
01:19:11,757 --> 01:19:13,725
What isn't your fault?

369
01:19:15,661 --> 01:19:17,424
But what an awakening!

370
01:19:17,629 --> 01:19:19,392
Enough to drive you mad.

371
01:19:35,714 --> 01:19:37,045
You know everything now.

372
01:19:37,716 --> 01:19:39,479
You still want to marry me?

373
01:19:42,654 --> 01:19:44,383
You'll be ashamed of me later.

374
01:19:46,358 --> 01:19:48,588
You'll never blame me
for any of this?

375
01:19:49,328 --> 01:19:50,693
Never.

376
01:19:50,896 --> 01:19:52,727
A commitment for life?

377
01:19:55,734 --> 01:19:57,167
But, Jacques, marriage...

378
01:19:58,303 --> 01:19:59,531
it's out-of-date.

379
01:19:59,738 --> 01:20:03,572
We'll still marry. We'll be poor,
but I'll work twice as hard.

380
01:20:05,978 --> 01:20:07,411
You bore me.

381
01:20:09,448 --> 01:20:11,279
Don't be angry.

382
01:20:13,185 --> 01:20:15,745
You see our names carved
on this bench,

383
01:20:15,954 --> 01:20:17,854
our games with Balthazar.

384
01:20:18,624 --> 01:20:20,455
But I don't see a thing.

385
01:20:20,793 --> 01:20:22,818
I've no more tenderness, no heart,

386
01:20:23,128 --> 01:20:24,686
no feelings.

387
01:20:24,897 --> 01:20:27,263
Your words don't affect me anymore.

388
01:20:28,934 --> 01:20:32,563
Our vows of love,
our childhood promises,

389
01:20:32,838 --> 01:20:35,204
were in a world of make-believe,

390
01:20:35,441 --> 01:20:37,068
not reality.

391
01:20:39,278 --> 01:20:41,303
Reality is different.

392
01:21:02,835 --> 01:21:04,268
I'll love him.

393
01:21:22,788 --> 01:21:24,278
I mustn't be late.

394
01:21:25,491 --> 01:21:27,015
Don't go. Forget them.

395
01:21:27,226 --> 01:21:29,990
I want to have it out with them.

396
01:23:46,565 --> 01:23:49,193
They stripped her, beat her
and locked her in.

397
01:24:57,903 --> 01:24:59,393
Marie's gone.

398
01:25:00,238 --> 01:25:01,205
Gone?

399
01:25:01,873 --> 01:25:03,101
She'll never come back.

400
01:25:26,164 --> 01:25:28,724
He's in despair. Comfort him.

401
01:26:02,334 --> 01:26:05,303
You must forgive. Everyone.

402
01:26:06,738 --> 01:26:09,366
Much will be forgiven you.
You have suffered.

403
01:26:11,843 --> 01:26:14,141
I may suffer less than you think.

404
01:26:21,653 --> 01:26:23,678
"God does not forsake forever.

405
01:26:23,889 --> 01:26:27,120
He may punish,
yet he will have compassion.

406
01:26:27,592 --> 01:26:31,221
He does not willingly afflict
the children of men."

407
01:26:49,648 --> 01:26:52,913
Lord, don't take him from me too.
Wait.

408
01:26:53,752 --> 01:26:56,277
You know how sad and miserable
my life will be.

409
01:27:50,742 --> 01:27:51,640
Lend him to us.

410
01:27:51,910 --> 01:27:54,743
He's worked enough.
He's old. He's all I have.

411
01:27:55,847 --> 01:27:56,871
Just for a day.

412
01:27:57,282 --> 01:27:59,147
Besides, he's a saint.

413
01:29:45,557 --> 01:29:46,524
Perfume.

414
01:30:04,509 --> 01:30:05,703
Stockings.

415
01:30:10,649 --> 01:30:11,911
Gold.

416
01:32:00,125 --> 01:32:02,116
<i>Customs! Halt!</i>
