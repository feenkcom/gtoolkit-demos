! GToolkit DocumenterDocumenter makes creating and ""consuming"" documentation a beautiful experience. Let's explore three use cases where Documenter improves the experience.!! Documenting SoftwareDocumenting software used to be (before Documenter) an unpleasant experience for most of developers. One, reason is that developers create a software product and then documentation separated, writing text, copy&pasting code, and taking screenshots:+file://creating-documetation.png+Documenter, on other hand, directly embeds code and makes the examples explorable: ${inputFile:path=look.pillar}$ The same documentation can be also written directly in class comments: ${class:name=BrButtonLabelLookExamples}$!! Teaching SoftwareDocumenter can be also used for teaching. It makes it possible to follow a tutorial step by step, change a code in the tutorial, and compare changes.${icebergFile:path=feenkcom/gtoolkit-examples/doc/tutorial/examples-tutorial.pillar}$!! Data Science Documenter is also useful for data science. Researchers obtain some interesting data:[[[height=300|show=gtPictureFor:pictureFile := GtIcebergUtility repositoriesLocation 		/ 'feenkcom'		/ 'gtoolkit-demos' 		/ 'data' 		/ 'faceapi' 		/ '1280px-Einstein-with-habicht-and-solovine.jpg'.pictureForm := pictureFile binaryReadStreamDo: [ :aStream |		(ImageReadWriter formFromStream: aStream) ].picture := GtCSPicture new.picture pictureForm: pictureForm.]]]Perform an analysis, using libraries and services. [[[height=100|show=gtItemsFor:faceData := { 	GtCSExamplesData jsonFaceLandmarksSolovine.	GtCSExamplesData jsonFaceLandmarksEinstein.	GtCSExamplesData jsonFaceLandmarksHabicht.}]]]And finaly, reseachers do some visualization: [[[face := GtCSFace new		rectangle: ((279@313) corner: (378@412)).face landmarks: (GtCSFaceLandmarks fromDictionary: (faceData at: 3)).]]][[[height=250|show=gtFaceLandmarksViewFor:picture ensureFacesStorage.picture addFace: (faceWithPicture := face copy).faceWithPicture.]]]%So  me interesting reading about *The First Notebook War>https://yihui.name/en/2018/09/notebook-war/* !!
